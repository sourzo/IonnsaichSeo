Big Plan:
* Add lessons. Sort the lessons into categories to make menu navigation easier.
* Text formatting?

Overall app:
 - when selecting pronouns, include names?

Issues/bugs:
 - Currently if there is more than one translation in a dictionary (e.g. in adjectives_food, searbh = sour and searbh = bitter) then it is decided by row number (index) - which might be frustrating to the user.

Additional modules:
 - verbs & tense 
   ... imperative
   ... (in)formal
   ... habitual action
   ... relative future
   ... need
 - number and time
   ... time
   ... plurals & numbers?
   ... ordinals
   ... "in" months and seasons
   ... personal numbers
   ... when (this/last month/year, yesterday, d-b yesterday, etc)
 - possessive article
   ... prep possessive
 - adjectives
   ... adjectives before the noun (sean/seann?)
   ... adverbs
   ... mì-(blah)
   ... gender and adjectives - include more than one adjective
 - place (towns, countries)
   ... "I am going to"
   ... languages (pp rium?)
   ... opposites? in/out, inside/outside, (over) here/there/yonder, this/that/yon, up/down, etc
   ... reach/arrive, go/went, etc
   ... bho/do + def. article
 - greetings/conversation
   ... vocative, fhìn/fhèin
   ... commands, greetings, questions
   ... how are you, feelings (different sentence structures) (also mood - interest in, etc)
   ... questions - how, what, when, who, why
   ... weather phrases (different sentence structures)
 - clothes & pp-orm (also body parts: hair/head on you, other body parts at you)
 - prepositions with(out) lenition (ro, cho, glè) 
 - ri: talk with, meet with, etc; le (use with)
 - dative, genitive?

Vocab:
 - add vocative to names list?

Strengths & Limitations of code:
+ it ignores capitalisation in user answers
+ it ignores leading and trailing spaces in user answers
- it does not ignore accents
- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
- you have to specify singular or plural when translating "you" into English
