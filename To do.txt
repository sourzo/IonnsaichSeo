Big Plan:
* Add lessons. Sort the lessons into categories to make menu navigation easier.
* Text formatting?

Overall app:
 - when selecting pronouns, include names?
 - lessons to be grouped into hierarchy

Issues/bugs, or things for improvement:
 - Currently if there is more than one translation in a dictionary (e.g. in adjectives_food, searbh = sour and searbh = bitter) then it is decided by row number (index) - which might be frustrating to the user.
 - Function to take either option if there's a slash? eg your/his
 - user response = "any" -> random option?
 - user response = "all" (vocab sample selection) -> max number?

Additional modules:

   ... imperative
   ... (in)formal
   ... habitual action
   ... relative future
   ... need

 - adjectives
   ... adjectives before the noun (sean/seann?)
   ... adverbs
   ... mì-(blah)
   ... gender and adjectives - include more than one adjective

   ... "I am going to"
   ... languages (pp rium?)
   ... opposites? in/out, inside/outside, (over) here/there/yonder, this/that/yon, up/down, etc

Strengths & Limitations of code:
+ it ignores capitalisation in user answers
+ it ignores leading and trailing spaces in user answers
- it does not ignore accents
- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
- you have to specify singular or plural when translating "you" into English
